The rigid-block equilibrium (RBE) method uses a penalty formulation to
measure structural infeasibility or to guide the design of stable
discrete-element assemblies from unstable geometry.
However, RBE is a purely force-based formulation,
and it incorrectly describes stability when
complex interface geometries are involved.
To overcome this issue, this paper introduces
the coupled rigid-block analysis (CRA) method,
a more robust approach building upon RBEâ€™s strengths.
The CRA method combines equilibrium and kinematics in a penalty formulation
in a nonlinear programming problem.
An extensive benchmark campaign is used to show how CRA enables
accurate modelling of complex three-dimensional discrete-element assemblies
formed by rigid blocks.
In addition, an interactive stability-aware design process to
guide user design towards structurally-sound assemblies is proposed.
Finally, the potential of our method for real-world problems are demonstrated
by designing complex and scaffolding-free physical models.
